megaLib is a Python wrapper for the [Megaport RESTful API](https://dev.megaport.com/).

[Megaport](https://www.megaport.com/) operates a global, Software Defined Network which enables their customers to 
manage their connectivity in close to real time. The Megaport API allows customers to interact with their account in 
the same way as they might using the [Web Portal](https://portal.megaport.com/login).

Use the power of megaLib to order your very own virtual router in the cloud with connectivity to AWS in just a few 
lines:

## How it Works
megaLib functions as a Python wrapper for the [public Megaport API](https://api.megaport.com/) by providing a library of 
functions to simplify your next mega-project.

[Megaport Knowledgebase Articles](https://knowledgebase.megaport.com/open-api/) on the API.
